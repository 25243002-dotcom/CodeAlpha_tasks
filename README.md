1️ Basic Calculator (Matrix Operations – Beginner)

This program performs basic 3×3 matrix operations:

Features

Input matrix elements

Matrix Addition

Matrix Multiplication

Matrix Transpose

Display matrices neatly

Concepts Used

Functions in C

2D Arrays

Loops and condition handling

How to Run

gcc basic_calculator.c -o calculator
./calculator

2️ Matrix Operations (Medium)

This project is an enhanced version of matrix operations using modular functions.

Operations Supported

Matrix Input & Display

Matrix Addition

Matrix Multiplication

Matrix Transpose

Concepts Used

Modular Programming

Matrix Logic

Search student by ID

Data stored in students.dat

Student Structure

struct Student {
    int id;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
};


Concepts Used

Structures

File Handling (Binary Files)

Menu-driven Program
